## Overview
Personal Note App is a local-first notes application. All your notes and data are stored only on your device. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information with third parties.

## Data Collection
- **No personal data is collected.**
- All notes are saved locally on your device using SQLite.
- The app works offline and does not transmit any note content or personal data externally.

## Internet Connectivity
- **Google Fonts**: The app uses Google Fonts API to download and cache Arabic fonts for text display. This requires an internet connection on first use of each font. Once downloaded, fonts are cached locally. No personal data is sent to Google.
- **Share Feature**: When you choose to share a note, the app uses your device's native sharing functionality to send text to other apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook). The sharing happens directly on your device; no data passes through our servers.

## Permissions
- **Storage access**: To save your notes locally in SQLite database.
- **Internet access**: To download Google Fonts on first use (fonts are cached afterwards).
- No other permissions are required.

## Third-Party Services
- **Google Fonts**: Used to provide high-quality Arabic font rendering. Google Fonts privacy policy: https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy
- The app does not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Children’s Privacy
- The app is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
